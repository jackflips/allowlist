### VPN/Proxy Apps

Found 39 VPN/proxy apps. All appear to be legitimate privacy/security tools from established providers (OpenVPN, HMA, Browsec, TorGuard, PureVPN, etc.). These are appropriate for the allowlist.

### Low-Rated Apps

77 apps with rating below 2.5. Reviewed lowest-rated - all are legitimate apps from established companies (SBI, AT&T, FAA, postal services, airlines). Low ratings appear to reflect poor app quality rather than inappropriate content.

## Observations

1. **No Category Data:** All apps in this batch have empty Category field - this appears to be a data issue in the source
2. **App Quality:** 66.9% of apps have good or excellent ratings (4.0+)
3. **Legitimate Use Cases:** Apps are primarily productivity, finance, communication, and utility apps appropriate for dumbphone use
4. **No Red Flags:** No gambling, adult content, or inappropriate apps detected

## Recommendation

**APPROVE** - Batch 3 apps are appropriate for the dumbphone allowlist. No changes required.
