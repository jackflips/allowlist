### Browsers (37 apps) - NOTED
Web browsers present in batch. These enable access to any web content but are also essential utilities. Current policy appears to allow browsers.

## Flagged for Optional Review

The following 3 apps are cryptocurrency exchange/trading platforms. While not inherently problematic, these can encourage compulsive price-checking behavior. Flag for policy discussion:

| App ID | Name | Concern |
|--------|------|---------|
| com.binance.dev | Binance: Buy Bitcoin & Crypto | Active trading platform |
| com.binance.us | Binance.US: Buy BTC, DOGE, XRP | Active trading platform |
| com.ascendex.exchange | AscendEX: Buy & Sell Crypto | Active trading platform |

**Note:** Other crypto apps in batch are wallets (Trezor, AlphaWallet, Exodus) which are storage-only and not flagged.

## Recommendation

**APPROVE BATCH** - No changes required. The 3 crypto exchange apps are noted for policy consideration but do not block batch approval.
